TrackDrown has the purpose of lowering the possibilities of losing valuable items, such as wallets, bags, backpacks, laptops etc. and reducing the chances of having valuable objects stolen. The system is based on the localization of antennas (one antenna per valuable item) in the indoor spaces of the campus. A series of detectors displaced inside the campus will track the antennasâ€™ movements, and store the collected information in a database. Whenever a suspicious movement of an antenna is detected (e.g. one antenna departs from the others), an alert is sent to the user.
