Poliroute is a smart system aimed to guide the user in the “Cittadella”, driving himto his destination. All this is done using an interactive system, composed of arrows made with LEDs and touchscreen on the starting point. In all the area of “Cittadella” some touchscreen were be disposed, which are the starting point. The screen indicates the users's positionon a map and he can select the destination. The system will calculate the minimum walk and will indicate the color associated to his path. In order to understand how far is the destination, it also indicates the distance. The system will give him a bracelet and the screen gives him the first indication to follow.
