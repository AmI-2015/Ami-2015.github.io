Students spends a lot of time in Politecnico, and between the lessons they need to find a place to relax and feel comfortable. The aim of Polify is to improve the breaks and the meal time giving to students a new enhanced experience in the dedicated spaces near bars and canteen.

Polify will automatically play music based on the musical taste of users in the room, a radio that can adapt itself to the constant changing of the audience composition.
