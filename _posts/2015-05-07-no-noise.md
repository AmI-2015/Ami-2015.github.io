Nobody likes noisy classrooms, and it's always hard to find a quiet place to study especially if you have an exam in the next week. So why not having a system that searches for you the right place to get focused? Our project is exactly what you've been waiting for: NoNoise will help you! It detects the noise level in the classrooms, then an application suggests you the most silent places where to go. In addition, in the classrooms there is a colorful bulb that gives to the people inside a feedback about how noisy they are, so they can control their voices.
