To make the Cittadella Politecnica more intelligent, the Class-Aid replaces an existing feature, the classrooms schedule, improving it by making it interactive, versatile, easy to use, beneficent to students and to the environment. This is done by exploiting pre-existing data to supply the students with the most up to date information about the place where they spend most of their time: the classroom.
