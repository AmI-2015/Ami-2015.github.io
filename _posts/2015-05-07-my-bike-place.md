MyBikePlace suggests you the nearest place to you or, if you prefer, to your classroom for leaving quickly and safely your bike. MyBikePlace also helps you reach your bike if youâ€™re forgetting it, showing where you parked it on the campus map. Moreover, if you register your arrival at the parking and someone else tries to stole your bike, MyBP avoids the theft warning you with a notification and activating an alarm at the stand.
