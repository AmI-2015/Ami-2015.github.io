MyGuide is a project aimed to help the visually impaired navigate inside Politecnico di Torino Campus. Our goal is to remove barriers, create solutions and expand possibilities to help users achieve their full potential as Polito students. The highly reliable GPS system does not provide indoor positioning in Politecnico di Torino. Thus what is needed is a reliable indoor positioning and navigation system for the visually impaired to be able to maneuver around the Politecnico campus.
