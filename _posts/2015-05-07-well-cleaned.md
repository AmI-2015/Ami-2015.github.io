W.C. is an application you can run both on smart-phones and tablets, and provides a compact, fast and easy way to check the bathrooms' status, in terms of amount of trash in trash cans, amount of soap, presence (or lack) of toilet paper. It consists of a very simple map of the Politecnico, that shows where all the bathrooms are located, specifying if they are men-only, women-only or both men-women ones. Using an intuitive color system, it also indicates whether that place is in a "fine condition" or not, differentiating, in the latter case, the gravity of the situation.
