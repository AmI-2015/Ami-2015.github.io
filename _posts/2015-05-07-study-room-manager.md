Study room manager will organize and manage in a smart way the places in the study room. An organized environment is also a more quiet environment, so a better environment to study. So the result is not just happier students, because they are efficiently using their time to study without loosing time to find a place, but also school administration since the facilities are properly used by the people who really need it.
