EasyPark is a project that improves and simplifies the parking system of the Politecnico di Torino. Its main goal is to find an alternative to an everyday problem that can be tedious and annoying, involving the user. This solution will smartly decrease the traffic flow around the campus parkings, making the area more organized and avoiding people to waste time seeking for a free spot.
